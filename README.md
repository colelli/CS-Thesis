# Company Situational-Awareness based on Risk Assessments
<div align="justify">
My experimental Bachelor's thesis will examine the field of Cyber Security and more particularly the way
awareness of a company is valued based on the risk assessment and the data collected.<br/>
In this project I will start from gathering the information needed to establish a baseline for future measurements,
and then use the baseline to unstarstand the different aspects detected to drive an overall evaluation of the
organization's vulnerability severity using a mix of techniques that I will further discuss as I develop them.
